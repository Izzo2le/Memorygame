To begin my ‘Memory Game’ I created an initial plan, I drew out my layout and tried to stick to it as much as possible. There were some amendments which I made during the website review, which I felt created a better, easier experience for my users.

User experience UX

As a user I wanted my game to be easy to use for all ages 
As a user I wanted to have clear instructions before the game started so as theres  a clear idea of what was expected from the game 
As a user I wanted the time and how many goes have been had, clearly shown above the game board.
As a user I want to be able to see my final time and tries at the end of my game with a choice to play again.

Site owners aims 

As the game creator I wanted to be able to create a fun and easy to follow game.
As the game creator I wanted to show users a fun way to play the memory card game with the use of puppies.
As the owner I wanted to create a easy to follow points system which shows the timer and how many goes the user has had to find each pair.
As the owner I wanted to create a game which introduces people to JavaScript in a colourful exciting way. 

Colour scheme 

I chose to go for a pink colour scheme due to it representing fun, liveliness and femininity. I aim for my website to be geared towards all genders but I wanted to introduce females to the idea of coding and how it is a universal language which can complement creativity..
I used a pink paw print background for my main page and a dark rose pink () for the game page with a lighter pink () for my game board.
